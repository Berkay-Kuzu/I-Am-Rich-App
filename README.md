# I-Am-Rich-App
This is a very basic iOS app which contains only a label, I Am Rich, and an image, diamond. I also changed background color, label color and arranged constraints as a reset to suggested constraints to make fit for every iPhone. This is the first app I created with Swift. This app can be seen as a sign of my iOS app development journey.
